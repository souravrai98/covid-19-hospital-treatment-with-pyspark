# Covid-19 Hospital-Treatment with PySpark

In this project we examine various models on the covid 19 hospital treatment dataset. You can find the dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/covid19-hospital-treatment.
This project is made with pyspark. I have explored several models like Random Forest, Decision tress and others but the maximum accuracy I could get is 42%. 
More data exploration is needed on this dataset. I am open to suggestions for further improvements.


I made this project as part of my course on Distributed Big Data.
